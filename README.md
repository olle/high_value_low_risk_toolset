# High Value Low Risk Toolset

In 2014 I wrote down my thoughts on frontend software development toolsets, as
a reaction to a request for a rather strict evaluation of the (at the time)
most popular frameworks, for a customer project.

**[high_value_low_risk_toolset.md](./high_value_low_risk_toolset.md)**

_As I recall there were different tools and frameworks being evaluated, from a
plethora of alternatives. And I tried to get my point through, that using
HTML/CSS/JS would be quite enough, and that there was no perfect framework to
choose, without understanding the specific goals and expectations. No one would
listen. So I jotted down my thoughts, and posted it to the project manager._
